# domain_scanner
Python Script that scans a domain infinetly and alerts the user through a message box if it detects a new subdomain.

# How do I use this?

Simply extract the .zip and it's files to the same location (i.e. a folder in your documents or on your desktop, preferably a folder though as the program creates files). You can then double click the .py program, input a domain name and the program will alert you when a new domain is found.

You can leave it running, put it as a start-up program, do whatever you want with it. Change the code, make it better and we can collaborate on the project. All I ask is you send it to me and I can adjust this github repo. I literally put this together whilst drinking beer and downloading Genshin Impact. It's messy, it's functionally low, but it's pretty easy to use and I like it :)
